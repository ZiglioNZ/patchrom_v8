    How to install the Windows XP USB kernel mode driver for AP15/AP16/AP20 
    recovery mode.

Introduction
    
    Microsft provides a generic kernel mode driver starting in their new Windows
    Driver Foundation (WDF) acritecture. This is a prefeered model for USB
    drivers and works on Windows XP and Vista operating system.
    
    Nvidia provides the customized inf file to install the winusb.sys file. Once
    the driver is installed applicaitons can talk to the AP1x bootrom USB stack
    using the winusb.dll user mode APIs.


Creating Driver disks

    To create a driver installation directory use the following script
    instal.bat in the current directory. This will create the directory
    c:\temp\nvidia_usb_drivers 

    For the script to run P4ROOT should be set and NT6 ddk build number 6000 
    should be synced.

    Nt6 build 6001.18002 is installed in perforce at 

    //sw/tools/ddk/nt6/6001.18002/....

How to use NvidiaUsb.inf to install the kernel driver

    Once the driver installation directory is created, plug in the USB cable
    with the AP1x system in USB recovery mode. (How to configure the AP1x system
    to be in bootrecovery mode is beyond the scope of this doc. Pleas refer to
    hw/syseng docs).

    Windows system will pop up a window to install the driver. Guide the windows
    install application to the driver install directoy
    (c:\temp\nvidia_usb_drivers). From here on it is a standard procedure on
    installing any driver. Since the dirver is not signed you will get a
    security warning message - ignore that.

    Once the installation starts it might take *long* time - as much as 15 min.
    Please be patient, this installer has coinstaller and installs the 
    entire WDF framework - if already not installed
    

NOTE: THIS DRIVER IS AP1X RECOVERY MODE DEVICE, NOT OTHER KINDS OF USB DRIVER
LIKE RNDIS, MASS TRANSPORT ETC.
